# Netflix Clone - MERN Stack

This project represents the implementation of a Netflix clone built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Designed to replicate the core functionalities of the popular streaming platform, this application facilitates user authentication, content browsing, and video playback, all within a modern web framework. By leveraging the scalability and flexibility of the MERN stack, this project not only showcases fundamental web development concepts but also serves as a practical demonstration of full-stack development. The purpose of this clone is to offer a comprehensive foundation for learning and further experimentation in building complex web applications.
